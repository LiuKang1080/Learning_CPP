// Operator Overloading in C++

/*
Operator Overloading:
    - C++ allows overloading of most operators to work with our user defined classes. Intended to make code more readable, and
        writable.
    
    - What is Operator Overloading?
        - Traditional operators like +, -, *, / can be used with user defined types.
        - Allows user defined types to behave similar to built-in types.

    - The assignment operator ( = ) is overloaded for us automatically by the compiler. Has defualt operator overloading. We must
        explicitly define the other operators for overloading.

    - What operators can be overloaded?
        - Scope Resolution Operator     ::
        - Conditional Operator          :?
        - Pointer to member operator    .*
        - Dot Operator                  .
        - Sizeof Operator               sizeof

    - Just because an operator can be overloaded doesn't mean it should. We should only do it when it makes sense.
