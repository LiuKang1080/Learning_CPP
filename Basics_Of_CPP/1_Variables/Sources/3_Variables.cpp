// Variables, Primitive Types, and Constants in C++

/* 
    - Variables in C++
        - Abstraction for data in memory locations. Allows us to use names and words that programmers understand rather than 
            memory addesses.
        - Variables have a Data Type and a Value.
        - Variables MUST be declared BEFORE they can be used. C++ is a Statically Typed language (The data type of variables 
            cannot change once declared. The value of the varaible can change but the data type must be the same.)
