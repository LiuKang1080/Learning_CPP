// Implementing Class Member Methods in C++

/*
Member Methods:
    - Methods in classes are like functions.
    - Member methods have access to member attributes, so we do NOT need to pass in attributes as arguments.
    - We can implement methods inside class declarations (they will be implicitly inline).
        - For small methods it is acceptable to place them inside the class declaration, but for larger and more complex methods
            we can use multple files to define the classes and its methods.
    - In C++ it is common to seperate a class' specification from its implementations.
    - We can use seperate files: .h for the class declaration, and .cpp for the class implementation.
    - Methods can be implemented outside the class declaration (we need to use the scope resolution operator)
        Class_Name::method_name
    - Generally we want to seperate
