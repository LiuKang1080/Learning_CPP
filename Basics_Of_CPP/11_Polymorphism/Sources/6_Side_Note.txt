Side Note on Virtual Functions and Pure Virtual Functions
    - When we're dealing with Virtual functions OR pure virtual functions we MUST provide a body for the method!
    - Even if it is a destructor we MUST provide a body. We will get errors if we do not provide a body
    - The general rule is: If the method is a virtual method or a pure virtual method, then we MUST implement a code body!
        Even if it is empty!
        
    - ex) 

        virtual ~Shape();

    - This results in an error!

        virtual ~Shape() {};
    
    - This is the RIGHT way to do it!
    
Override Specifier Keyword:
    - We must place the override specifier keyword AFTER the function name. We CANNOT place the keyword wherever we want!

        virtual void draw() override {
            // code;
        }

    - The override keyword MUST come AFTER the method name!

        override virtual void draw() {
            // code;
        }

    - This will result in an ERROR!
