// C++ Boost, What is it? When to use it?

/*
What is the C++ Boost Library?
	- C++ Boost library offers a wide verity of smaller libraries dedicated to a certain section of C++
	- Boost offers a wide verity of functions and methods that naturally work with and extend the C++ standard.
		- We can convert data to and from std::string
		- We can extend shorts, ints, longs, floats, and doubles into unbounded very large numbers
		- Boost also provides libraries for Multithreading (mutex, atmoics), and Async.
		- Managing resources like std::unique_ptr, and std::shared_ptr
		- Boost also offers image manipulation, and graphing capabilities.
		- Access to directories, timers, files, and networking services.

When to use the C++ Boost library?
	- The Boost libraries won't get outdated since more and more boost libraries are becoming part of the C++ standard.
	- We use the Boost libraries when we want to extend the C++ standard.

We will cover:
	1) Return an Array from a function, and the boost::array library.
		- This will make it easier to work with arrays compared to vanilla C++ arrays. The STL array is better compared to the vanilla
			C++ array, but boost::array will expand that even further.

	2) C++11 and C++14 algorithms. 
		- We will cover some boost algorithms and how they compare with the C++ standards.
